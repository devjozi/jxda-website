# AI COLLABORATION RULES — JX Distribution Website

This file defines how AI tools must assist on this project.

The goal is:
- Learning and understanding
- Not blind copy-paste
- Long-term developer growth

---

## Core Rules (Mandatory)

1. **Explain before code**
   - Before editing or creating files, explain:
     - What will be changed
     - Why it is needed
     - What problem it solves

2. **Teach, don’t just output**
   - Assume the developer wants to understand:
     - Next.js behavior
     - Static export logic
     - Folder structure decisions
   - Use plain language, not buzzwords

3. **Comment everything**
   - Every edited file must include:
     - A short file-level comment explaining its purpose
     - Inline comments for non-obvious logic
   - Code should be readable 6 months later without context

4. **No silent refactors**
   - Do not reorganize files or refactor code
   - unless explicitly approved beforehand

5. **Incremental changes only**
   - One logical change at a time
   - Avoid “big bang” rewrites

---

## Migration-Specific Rules

- This is a controlled migration
- Visual output must remain unchanged
- Bootstrap + HTML remain primary
- Next.js is used only for structure and scalability

---

## When Unsure

If anything is ambiguous:
- Ask before acting
- Do not assume intent

---

## Definition of Success

Success is:
- The developer can explain what was done
- The codebase is understandable without AI
- The site builds and exports cleanly
